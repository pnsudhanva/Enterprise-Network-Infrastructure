# Enterprise-Network-Infrastructure
A network simulation project using Cisco packet-tracer that showcases a network design by adapting DHCP, OSPF, RSTP, HSRP, ACLs, and VLANs.



**IP addressing scheme:**
-> Developed an IP addressing scheme by efficiently performing subnetting to support up to 80+ hosts in the network.
-> All the assignment of IP address to the hosts are handled by the DHCP server by also including options subnet range, max-lease-time, address pool, and domain name.
